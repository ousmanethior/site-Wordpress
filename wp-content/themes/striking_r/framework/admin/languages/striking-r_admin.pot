"<h3 align='center'>INTRODUCTION</H3>\n"
"<p align='justify'>A portfolio item is a custom post type developed "
"especially for our theme. &nbsp;Its purpose is to allow for creation of "
"varied types of media content that can be displayed in condensed form via a "
"list in a webpage, and each list item may by choice lead to a full post "
"webpage.  &nbsp;The full post can contain expanded descriptive content fully "
"customized as desired. &nbsp;So a portfolio &#34;item&#34; is simply a post, "
"and like the better known blog post, it can have short form display (lists, "
"widgets) and long form display as a full webpage with as much content as "
"needed.</p>\n"
"<h4>Difference between a Portfolio List and a WP Gallery, and Featured Image "
"vs a Thumbnail Image</h4>\n"
"<p align='justify'>Please go to the <a href='%1s' target='_blank'>Striking -"
"> Portfolio Panel</a> and review the information on this topic found in the "
"panel Help tab (the Help tab is found in the upper right hand corner and "
"when clicked upon will open a dropdown containing help content).</p>\n"
"<h4>PORTFOLIO TYPES AND REQUIREMENTS</h4>\n"
" <p align='justify'>There are <u>9 different Portfolio Types</u> available "
"in Striking MultiFlex designed to fulfill every conceivable portfolio "
"display requirement.  &nbsp;The <b>Set the Portfolio Type of this Post</b> "
"setting below has a detailed help field discussing the 9 types and the use "
"for each.  &nbsp;After selecting a type in the dropdown field its "
"corresponding admin tab (left of this dialogue) will become active and this "
"is where the specific settings for that portfolio type can be adjusted.</p>\n"
"<p align='justify'><u>Please note it is necessary to set a featured image, "
"and give the portfolio item a title</u> for all Portfolio Types other then "
"the HTML Portfolio type (which does not require a Featured Image). &nbsp;The "
"Portfolio Type choice determines the action of the featured image thumbnail "
"when selected by a site viewer - it will either open a lightbox with content "
"or transport the website viewer somewhere else in the site, or even to an "
"external url.</p>\n"
"<p align='justify'>A portfolio list inserted in any page or post content in "
"the site can range in size from just one item in the list to as many as "
"desired. &nbsp;All the settings for creating a list/display of portfolio "
"items in any webpage are found in the portfolio shortcode, and portfolio "
"behaviours that one desires to standardize for lists or the post page are "
"set in the <a href='%2s' target='_blank'>Striking -> Portfolio Panel</a>.</"
"p>\n"
"<p align='justify'>The shortcode allows for display of portfolio items that "
"have been placed together into a category, to display multiple portfolio "
"categories (which may contain many individual portfolio items between them) "
"or to choose specific portfolio items by name for display in a list. &nbsp;"
"The shortcode allows for complete control over what is displayed each time a "
"portfolio list is created, how it is ordered, and what is displayed along "
"with the thumbnail image. &nbsp;There are 26 settings in the shortcode some "
"of which are for overriding the <b>Portfolio Panel</b> default settings for "
"unique situations.</p>\n"
"<p align='justify'> Most portfolio types list thumbnail images open into a "
"lightbox. &nbsp;In some instances one sets the lightbox size in a Portfolio "
"Type tab. &nbsp;If there is no individual setting, then the lightbox size "
"will be per the settings found in the <a href='%3s' "
"target='_blank'>Portfolio Panel->Lightbox Dimensions Tab</a>.</p>\n"
"<p align='justify'>However, Image portfolio types have a special setting "

"<p align='justify'><p><strong>PORTFOLIO TYPES:</strong><ul>\n"
"<li><strong><u>IMAGE</u></strong> - The Image portfolio type is dual "
"purpose. &nbsp;Normally it is a thumbnail image which opens up into a larger "
"size in a lightbox when the thumbnail is clicked by the viewer ->the "
"lightbox opening is automatic. &nbsp;The Image type also allows for image "
"substitution so that one image shows as the thumbnail in a portfolio list, "
"and another image will show up in the lightbox. &nbsp;The image substitution "
"setting is found within the Image admin tab.</li>\n"
"<li><strong><u>VIDEO</u></strong> - The theme supports Youtube, Vimeo, and "
"unique feature to the Striking theme is that it also supports self-hosted "
"mp4 video as a portfolio item. &nbsp;The settings for the url link, and "
"lightbox size are found in the Video tab. &nbsp;One loads a featured image "
"to serve as the thumbnail image in the portfolio list, and when a viewer "
"clicks on the image, it opens a lightbox containing the video per the "
"settings in the Video tab.<br /><br />If an mp4 video, it should be loaded "
"up in advance by using the &#34;Add New Media&#34; function of the media "
"library or by ftp into a subfolder in your site, and make a note of the file "
"path for the url field in the video admin settings.</li>\n"
"<li><strong><u>AUDIO</u></strong> - The Audio type is for embedding an .mp3 "
"in a pop up lightbox. &nbsp; A featured image must still be set to act as "
"the portfolio list thumbnail for the audio file, and when the thumbnail is "
"clicked, the audio item shows up in a lightbox. &nbsp;The settings for the "
"audio link, autoplay and loop are found in the Audio Tab. &nbsp;The mp3 it "
"should be loaded up in advance by using the &#34;Add New Media&#34; function "
"of the media library or by ftp into a subfolder in your site, and make a "
"note of the file path for the url field in the audio admin settings.</li>\n"
"<li><strong><u>LIGHTBOX</u></strong> - The Lightbox type is an example of a "
"feature which has both simple, and expert user level facets to its use.  "
"&nbsp;Simple uses can be using an iframe or embed code to display a pdf, to "
"use an iframe to display within the frame another url, or for displaying any "
"other content one wants to have show up in an iframe or lightbox. &nbsp;The "
"Iframe url field, lightbox content and width and height fields are found in "
"the Lightbox tab.<br /><br />The expert level functionality comes from the "
"fact the Lighbox Portfolio type can be very powerful for customization (just "
"like the lightbox shortcode), as advanced users with html and css skills can "
"design sophisticated custom content for the lightbox. &nbsp;See the settings "
"in the Lightbox tab for more info.</li>\n"
"<li><strong><u>DOC</u></strong> - The Doc type is another unique Striking "
"portfolio type that allows embedding of many common file types using the "
"Google Docs Viewer including PDF, Word, Powerpoint, Excel, Zips and much "
"more (see Doc tab settings for expanded list). &nbsp;On a desktop viewport "
"the document will open in a lightbox. &nbsp;For mobile viewports this "
"portfolio type has direct link fallback since support and behavior across "
"mobile browsers & platforms is quite uneven for lightboxes with documents.</"
"li>\n"
"<li><strong><u>LINK</u></strong> - The Link portfolio type is non-lightbox "
"portfolio type which is sets the portfolio list thumbnail image link to "
"something other then the single portfolio post webpage. &nbsp;So when a Link "
"Portfolio type, the settings in the Link tab allow choosing direct linking "
"to any site page, category, blog or custom post, or to link to any other url "
"(internal or external). &nbsp;Like all other portfolio types, its necessary "
"to set a featured image so that a thumbnail appears in the list, which when "
"clicked by a site visitor, takes them to the link set in the Link admin tab. "
"</li>\n"
"<li><strong><u>HTML</u></strong> - with this portfolio type the list content "
"is created and styled entirely within the wp editor.  &nbsp;The <b>Help "
"Information</b> in the Portfolio Type: HTML tab has more information on "
"usage. </li>\n"
"<li><strong><u>PORTFOLIO GALLERY</u></strong> - is used to create a gallery "
"of grouped images, which will show up in the lightbox when the featured "
"image in the list is clicked upon for enlargement. &nbsp;The Portfolio "
"Gallery tab contains detailed help and the functions for loading the gallery "
"images.</li>\n"
"<li><strong><u>DOCUMENT</u></strong> - There is no admin tab for a Document "
"type portfolio item as it is a portfolio type whereby when a viewer clicks "
"on the thumbnail in a portfolio list, it transports the viewer directly to "
"the single portfolio post rather then opening up an enlarged version of the "
"thumbnail image in a lightbox.  \n"
"<br /><br />The only &#8220;setting&#8221; typically applicable to a "
"Document portfolio type (other then the content created in the post body) is "
"the actual loading of a featured image to act as the portfolio list "
"thumbnail. <br /><br />A Document type is similar in function to the Read "
"More button which when clicked moves the viewer to the single post webpage, "
"but by way of the image and is often used when not showing the Read More "
"Button in a portfolio list. <br /><br />In summary, a Document portfolio "
"type allows haveing any content desired in the portfolio post body, and the "
"Document setting causes the thumbnail image to act as a trigger to bring the "
"site viewer directly to the post page when they click upon it.</li></ul>\n"
"----------------------------\n"
"<p align='justify'>Sometimes there is confusion between the Link and "
"Document portfolio types. &nbsp;The Link type is used to bring the site "
"viewer to another webpage within a site or an external url when they click "
"on thumbnail image, whereas the Document type is used to bring the viewer to "
"the single portfolio post webpage when they click on the thumbnail image.</p>"

"<p align='justify'>The Portfolio HTML type enables creation of a custom "
"designed portfolio list items using the content of the wp editor in place of "
"the normal featured image.  &nbsp;Whereas typical portfolio items have an "
"arranged layout displaying a featured image, title, description, excerpt, "
"etc, for each post item, with an html portfolio item what is displayed in a "
"portfolio list will be exactly as it has been created in the content editor."
"</p>\n"
"<p align='justify'>An analogy for long time users of Striking is the html "
"slide in the Anything Slider. Or the content of a single slide in the "
"Revolution slider. &nbsp;The slide displays exactly what is input into the "
"editor, and similarly so with the HTML Portfolio item. &nbsp;Whether "
"displayed in a list, or the single post page, what is designed is exactly "
"what the viewer will see.</p>\n"
"<p align='justify'>It is envisioned that this portfolio type will most often "
"be displayed in a one column or two column list.  &nbsp;Content has to be "
"designed within the column width as the reference parameter (ie the html "
"content is designed knowing that it is to be employed in a one column full "
"width portfolio list - which provides the full width of 980px less padding "
"as the list content container, or a 2 column list with sidebar - which "
"provides a max width of 293px for content, and so on...). &nbsp;But any "
"number of columns can be utilized in either full width or page with sidebar "
"configuration.  &nbsp;There is absolute design freedom similar to the html "
"type slider.</p>\n"
"<p align='justify'><b>IMPORTANT:</b> &nbsp;Content will wrap according to "
"the normal viewports so it is advisable when designing to test the content "
"for its mobile behavior - the set portfolio types have special responsive "
"css rules which do not apply to the portfolio html type.</p>\n"
"<p align='justify'><u>OPTIONAL SETTINGS:</u> &nbsp;There are 3 optional "
"settings below (with theme defaults also in the Portfolio Panel). &nbsp;The "
"<b>Title</b> and <b>Read More</b> are convenience type settings.  &nbsp;The "
"Title field will show the Portfolio title and it will be place left "
"justified above the html content. &nbsp;The Read More is also left "
"justified, below the html content. If employing H tags in the html content "
"likely the Title setting will not be used.  &nbsp;The Read More allows for "
"easy consistency of appearence if showing mixed portfolio lists which "
"include HTML portfolio items and linking to single post pages is being "
"accomplished by the read more (which is just an atag).  &nbsp;If you find "
"the spacing between the settings and the html content inadequate, just use a "
"br tag or a divider padding at the start and/or end of the html content.</"
"p>\n"
"<p align='justify'>HTML portfolio items do not require a featured image (as "
"the content is the substitute for the FI).  &nbsp;But an FI can be loaded if "
"desiring to have it associated with the post, and it will appear alongside "
"the editor content and the setting below is ON. &nbsp;If this setting is "
"active, the FI for the HTML type will act identically to the FI of all other "
"images in that list, per the settings in the shortcode. &nbsp;Depending on "
"the number of columns in the list the post content will either appear beside "
"or below the featured image.</p>\n"
"<p align='justify'>The other purpose of the featured image is to act as the "
"widget thumbnail if employing portfolio widgets in the website.  &nbsp;Thus "
"there are options:</p><ol>\n"
"<li>Do not load a featured image, but use the Default Widget Thumbnail "
"settings in the Portfolio Panel to supply the widget thumbnail image.</li>\n"
"<li>Upload a Featured Image that is the exact size of the widget thumbnails "
"- default size is 65 x 65 which can be adjusted in the Portfolio panel "
"Widget admin tab. &nbsp;This option provides the best control of the "
"thumbnail appearence.</li>\n"
"<li>Load up a Featured Image and either allow WP to auto resize/crop it to "
"the widget thumbnail image, or edit the image after uploading utilizing the "
"wp function for creating a custom thumbnail image.</li></ol>\n"
"<p align='justify'>The HTML portfolio item is a unique and powerful tool for "

"This theme has a number of special functions designed for use with the "
"Woocommerce plugin. &nbsp;Below is a list of some functions and abilities of "
"which to be aware:<br /><br />\n"
"<b>1)</b> &nbsp;As of version 1.0.2 the theme has been able to amend the woo "
"image function so that you can set a custom height for the various image "
"types in the Woo Settings.  This accomodates articles which are rectangular "
"in shape.  The theme continues to use our more feature filled lightbox "
"function rather then the default Woo function. &nbsp;So you should now go "
"to  Woocommerce/Settings/Catalogue/Image Options to set the height for "
"images. &nbsp;The width setting is fixed per the chart values below and if a "
"custom height value is entered into the woo settings it will be ignored. "
"&nbsp;Below are the image size settings for the Catalogue Image, Single "
"Product Image and Product Thumbnails, for full width and sidebar pages:<br /"
"><br />\n"
"<em>FULL WIDTH PAGE</em>:<br />\n"
"Catalogue image - 219px x custom height<br />\n"
"Single Product image - 294px x custom height<br />\n"
"Thumbnail image -  91px x custom height<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<em>SIDEBAR PAGE</em>:<br />\n"
"Catalogue image - 137px x custom height<br />\n"
"Single Product image - 294px x custom height<br />\n"
"Thumbnail image -  59px x custom height<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<i>IMPORTANT NOTES:</i>&nbsp; The minimum size of featured image one should "
"load is 550x550 due to the fact in some mobile viewports, on resizing "
"(example tablets) the responsive layout will feature a larger Single Product "
"Image then noted above. &nbsp;As long as the image ratio is respected, any "
"size image can be loaded. &nbsp;If the image uploaded doe not respect the "
"setting ratio, hard cropping of the image will occur.\n"
"<br /><br />\n"
"Since the theme lightbox function is used, one can go to the Lightbox tab "
"and select from the Fancybox or default theme skin for the lightbox "
"appearence. &nbsp;One can also enable lightbox thumbnails if so desired "
"should one have a Product Gallery for a product.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<b>2)</b> &nbsp;In the Edit Product Panel is a new metabox &#34;Image "
"Display Options&#34; which provides some image effects for hover over the "
"product image in the Shop page.\n"
"<br /><br />\n"
"<b>3)</b> &nbsp;When the WooCommerce setting is enabled below, one should "
"investigate the:<br /><br /><ul><li><u>Advance Panel</u> -> Search Tab, the "
"Custom Post Type Archive Featured Header Text Tab and Custom Taxonomy "
"Featured Header Text Tab</li>\n"
"<li><u>Sidebar Panel</u> -> Custom Post Sidebar tab, Custom Post Type "
"Archives Sidebar Tab & Custom Taxonomies Sidebar Tab</li></ul>\n"
"as upon activation of the plugin and the woocommerce activation setting, all "
"of these tabs will contain new options for custom Woo headers and sidebars "
"for various page and archive types on a global basis.  &nbsp;One can also "
"create custom sidebars and assign them to individual product pages using the "
"Custom Sidebar Setting in the Page General Options Metabox/General Page "
"Setup tab found below the content editor in the Edit Product Panel.\n"
"<br /><br />\n"
"<b>4)</b> &nbsp;One can use all of the Page General Options settings to "
"customize any individual Product post, and any of the default Woo Shop pages "
"one auto created using the Woocommerce/Settings/Pages panel. &nbsp;As well, "
"any autogenerated Shop type page, although it will automatically have a woo "
"shortcode in it, will also accept any other content you add to it including "
"theme shortcodes.\n"
"<br /><br />\n"
"<b>5)</b> &nbsp;Besides the ability to set global custom headers and "
"sidebars, the feature header of any page can be customized using the Header "
"Type setting in the Page General Options metabox, including slideshows.  "
"&nbsp;Even the Self-Galley slideshow option works, but it is best used in a "
"correctly sized slider by shortcode in the Custom Text Area Header Option.\n"
"<br /><br />\n"
"<b>6)</b> &nbsp;The theme modifies the Single Product Page layout to a "
"cleaner look without shadows, full frames around images, a more modern look "
"for tabs, and a different &#34;side-by-side&#34; layout for the product "
"image/gallery and the accompanying short description and tabs. &nbsp;The "
"Reviews tab layout is also modernized with full lightweight frame and the "
"stars being given their traditional gold color vs the Woo default grayblack "
"color.<br /><br />\n"
"The catalogue thumbnail layout has been similarly modified to a cleaner "
"design.<br /><br />\n"
"<b>7)</b> &nbsp;MultiFlex has a new ecommerce product carousel, which can "
"select individual products to display, with each image linking to the "
"specific product. &nbsp;This provides an opportunity to provide a nice "
"related product or featured product carousel on any single product post, or "
"any other content desired. &nbsp;More then one product carousel can be "
"inserted into any content.<br /><br />\n"
"<b>8)</b> &nbsp;Coding enabling parsing of custom breadcrumb functions from "
"WP SEO onto Woo pages.<br /><br />\n"
"<b>9)</b> &nbsp;Added auto RTL support for Woo in Striking MultiFlex<br /"
"><br />\n"
"<strong>Together the theme options and customizing abilities provide for "
"unlimited ability to display varied content and appearence for a store built "
"using Woo, with unique colors, backgrounds, sliders, and any particular "
"content desired to reinforce the product story and sales process.<br /><br /"

"<p>The first thing to know is that the settings below are mainly applicable "
"for users who:</p>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<p><b>A)</b> are on hosting (typically inexpensive hosting plans) "
"where they have low resource limits, in particular low available memory, "
"AND</p>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<p><b>B)</b> you have a website where the sum of posts/pages/"
"categories is several hundred or more items in total.<p>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<p>If you have say 200-300 items of all kinds or less, very likely "
"you did not need to utilize any of the settings in this Superlinks "
"administration.<p>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<p>In Portfolio post or a Slider Item creation/editing, among your "
"settings are options to link the featured image, and read more buttons to "
"other content in your website. We call this ability a &#34;Superlink&#34; as "
"behind the scenes we use code to build on-demand a  list (in programmer talk "
"we term this an &#34;array&#34;) of all posts/pages/portfolio/categories "
"items in a dropdown from which you can select your desired target to link. "
"In this instance its a &#34;super&#34; list due to the variety and amount of "
"items listed in the array.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<p>However, the on-demand creation of the superlink list, when you "
"have hundreds or more individual choices, can consume a significant amount "
"of memory. And for editing portfolio items, this list is assembled twice as "
"2 different settings provide superlinking options. If you are on a host "
"which has low memory values and you have a large number of items, the server "
"can run out of memory while attempting to create the superlinks, and so the "
"portfolio or slider edit panel will fail to display properly, or it will "
"load but be inoperable.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<p>With the settings below you can restrict the size of the list, "
"and sort it according to various criteria (which also impact the list "
"outcome) with the list size range of -1 to 1000. &nbsp;-1 is a default value "
"which results in all your pages/posts and categories displayed.  However, if "
"the amount of website content is such that the edit panels are experiencing "
"impairment, or you just find the list length impractical then it can be "
"limited with a maximum length of 1000 items.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<p>Even if restricting the superlink via the options below it is "
"still very easy to link to non-listed items simply by use of the <i>Link "
"Manually</i> option in the linking setting, and insert the full url to the "
"desired webpage in the blank field that appears when Link Mannually is "
"selected.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<p>The settings below apply to limiting the amount of blog and "
"portfolio posts that can appear as part of a list.  Usually pages and "
"categories make up only a small fraction of the total potential items for a "
"superlink.  A website might have 15 pages, but 500 blog or portfolio posts, "
"hence the settings below pertain to posts only at this time.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<p><b>EXPERT TIP:</b> Sometimes it is possible to increase the "
"allowable memory for the website via a line of code inserted into the wp-"
"config file in the website root.  Try to increase the memory value in the wp-"
"config.php by adding a line as follows:<br><br>\n"
"\t\t\t\tdefine('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '256M'); <br></p>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<p>After adjustment should the edit panel still not function "
"properly then use the Superlink settings. Another option is to contact your "
"host and determine if they are able to increase your available memory - "
"often you have to upgrade your plan to obtain a better memory value.</p>"

"shadows in styled elements such as buttons and images. &nbsp;As Striking "
"provides custom css fields for both theme wide use (General Panel) and for "
"specific webpages (Page General Options Metabox) the user has the ability to "
"decide when they might want to flatten elements such as section background "
"colors, buttons and images, such flattening can be page/post specific or "
"theme wide. &nbsp;Furthermore, all the Styled Box shortcodes and the Button "
"Shortcode have class fields so they can easily be assigned a class created "
"for flat design purposes.</p>\n"
"<p>Flat design is in fact a very old ability &#34;rediscovered&#34; "
"principally by google which incorporated flat design into its homepage "
"appearence in mid 2012. &nbsp;This immediately popularized this old ability "
"(at the start of the web all sites were flat design!) but within a short "
"period of time Google reverted to an Almost Flat Design appearence with some "
"gradients and shadows restored, because frankly full flat design is really "
"not very user friendly. &nbsp;So we suggest that flat design consideration "
"be but an element of a site, which is why Multiflex provides the ability to "
"remove the macro gradient and shadow elements, but keeps the minor ones that "
"assist in interpretation of content.</p>"

"<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>\n"
"<p>Striking MultiFlex has unparalleled choice of font display options for a "
"website with approx 840 different fonts plus 400+ icons available via 5 "
"different typography technologies: <br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<b>1)</b> 9 Standard Web Fonts including Serif, Sans-Serif and Monospace "
"fonts for use as the base body and descriptive font.<br />\n"
"<b>2)</b> 45 Cufon Font for use in custom & descriptive text replacement."
"<br />\n"
"<b>3)</b> 45 @font-face fonts for use in custom & descriptive text "
"replacement.<br />\n"
"<b>4)</b> 738 Google fonts for use in custom & descriptive text replacement."
"<br />\n"
"<b>5)</b> Font Awesome Icon set for use in Navigation & Sub-Navigation, "
"Buttons, Tab & Accordion Titles and via shortcode for general content usage."
"</p>\n"
"<h3>USAGE</h3>\n"
"<p>In this <b>General Settings Resource Tab</b> is the <b>Site Font Family</"
"b> setting which allows one to choose from 9 common web safe fonts to act as "
"the base font for the website. &nbsp;One does not need to do anything "
"further after selecting the base site font -> choosing another font(s) for "
"custom or descriptive text replacement is optional and depends on the degree "
"of customization and individuality desired for website appearence.</p>\n"
"<p>Descriptive Font Replacement refers to substituting the base font with "
"another font for various headers & titles used throughout the website "
"including the navigation & sub-navigation, h1 to h6 headers, blog titles, "
"portfolio titles, widget titles, etc.</p>\n"
"<p>Each of the custom font tabs has settings which allow for the choice of "
"activating one or more members of a custom font family (each font can be a "
"&#34;family&#34; with normal weight, bold, semi-bold, italics, narrow, "
"latin, etc and what is offered in the family differs for every single font), "
"a field for custom css to selectively replace only specific descriptive "
"types or other custom usage, and an &#34;All-in-One&#34; setting which if "
"activated sets one weight of a a custom font family techonology to be active "
"in replacing all descriptive text appearences in the website.</p>\n"
"<p>The <b>Font Size</b> tab and the Striking <a href='%1s' "
"target='_blank'>Striking -> Color</a> Panel have between them over 75 "
"settings for customizing the size and color of individual font elements such "
"as H tags, all titles, slider caption and description text, tab, accordion "
"and toggles, widget titles and much more.  &nbsp;Thus in Striking MultiFlex "
"one has the widest font variety and options to customize font usage in a "
"website and most customization is easily accomplished using theme settings "
"with no knowledge necessary of css, html or code in order to achive a unique "
"and interesting website appearence.</p>\n"
"<h3>NOTES ON EMPLOYING MULTIPLE FONTS </h3>\n"
"<p>Given all the font selections it is easy to get carried away with custom "
"font usage! &nbsp;However, there are some matters of which to be aware. "
"&nbsp;First is that the more fonts activated the more impact it will have on "
"the loading of website pages. &nbsp;More fonts active equates to more "
"scripting burden. &nbsp;The recommendation is that one should not employ "
"more then 2-4 custom fonts at the same time for descriptive/custom font "
"replacement in a website.</p>\n"
"<p>Secondly, this premium theme is a rarity in that it allows more then one "
"font technology to be active simultaneously for custom & descriptive "
"replacement, but be advised depending on matters such as plugins in use, "
"custom js & php employed in your site, and your host php version and "
"settings it can lead to unpredictable website behaviour. &nbsp;Unless you "
"are an advanced wordpress user with in-depth code and troubleshooting "
"knowledge, it is recommended not to employ more then one custom font "
"technology for replacement and we must <u>advise that any issues that arise "
"from employing multiple font techonologies for font replacement "
"simultaneously are not part of free product support for this theme.</u></p>\n"
"<h3>FONT AWESOME ICON FONT SET</h3>\n"
"<p>Font Awesome is scalable vector icons that <em>&#34;can be customized for "
"size, color, frame, and anything that can be done with the power of CSS.&#34;"
"</em> &nbsp;The name &#34;Font Awesome&#34; is somewhat misleading, as it "
"has nothing to do with base fonts or descriptive & custom text but rather is "
"all about providing icons (symbols, pictures, etc) for use as eye-catching "
"typography in a website. More detail on font awesome can be found at its "
"home at: <a href='http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/' "
"target='_blank'>Github</a> which provides visual examples of all the icons "
"in the set, as well as some custom usage examples.</p>\n"
"<p>As one might expect of Striking, the theme provides for very extensive "
"usage of the icon set:<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<b>a)</b> &nbsp;it is integrated into the Custom Menu individual navigation "
"styles so that one can display an icon alongside the navigation text for "
"each navigation menu item via a selector;<br />\n"
"<b>b)</b> &nbsp;it is integrated into the shortcodes for buttons, tabs and "
"accordions so that one can easily display an icon in a button, and in tab "
"titles and accordion titles;<br />\n"
"<b>c)</b> &nbsp;in the shortcode button under the typography shortcode group "
"is the shortcode &#34;Icon Font&#34; which provides for selecting and "
"manipulating by coloring, sizing, rotating, spinning, framing, and more an "
"icon which can be placed almost anywhere in content.</p>\n"
"<p>As font awesome usage requires loading another css file, there is a "
"setting for activing its usage -> the <b>Font Icons Integration</b> setting "
"is found below. &nbsp;The reason for the setting is so that if one is not "
"employing font awesome in the website, one is not hit with the css file "
"loading burden to the site scripting (it is fairly minimal but as they say "
"in webdesign (and physics!) <em>&#34;Every nanosecond counts... :)&#34;</em>."
"</p>\n"
"<h3>DEFAULT ICON FONT SETS</h3>\n"
"<p>Striking MultiFlex also employs a variety of open source icon sets for "
"use in the <b>Icon Text</b> and <b>Icon Link</b> shortcodes and for the "
"icons used in the social media and contact widgets. &nbsp;One can also "
"import new social media icon sets for use in the social media widget and the "
"settings for using them are found in this widget.</p>"

"<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>\n"
"<p>Cufon is a font-replacement technique that uses vector graphics and "
"javascript to write custom fonts from a font file (TTF, OTF or PFB) to your "
"browser. &nbsp;Cufon is a text replacement system, and thus any text that is "
"styled using it will not be able to be copied into the clipboard. &nbsp;To "
"learn more about Cufon visit the main cufon information page at <a "
"href='http://github.com/sorccu/cufon/wiki/About' target='_blank'>Gibhub "
"Cufon.</a> &nbsp;Many interesting free and paid variations of Cufon are "
"available and Striking includes 45 unique Cufon fonts.</p><p>Cufon was very "
"popular at its commencement in 2007 but the cufon javascript core has not "
"been updated in almost 2 years resulting in it&#180;s use falling out of "
"favour although many unique fonts are available only via Cufon. &nbsp;If one "
"is finding a selected Cufon font is rendering slowly or with issues it is "
"suggested that one consider the @fontface font technology for an "
"alternative. &nbsp;One advantage of Cufon fonts is that they are easier to "
"generate then @font-face font kits.</p>\n"
"<h3>CUFON DELAY</h3>\n"
"<p>Sometimes one will experience, depending on the browser, what is commonly "
"known as the <em>Cufon Delay.</em> &nbsp;In this situation a page loads, and "
"as one of the very last steps in the page loading process when java "
"scripting typically take place, the process of replacing the web font with "
"Cufon vectors is executed, sometimes with a visible effect and margin of "
"delay. &nbsp; Should this occur and you dislike it, the choice is to select "
"a different Cufon or other font type for use in your site.</p>\n"
"<h3>USING YOUR OWN CUFON FONT</h3>\n"
"<p>The cufon fonts that are provided in Striking contain only the Latin-1 "
"character set. &nbsp;Special characters such as some currency symbols and "
"alphabets such as the cyrillic alphabet, russian alphabet etc, will not show "
"correctly. &nbspOne can create a custom cufon font to address special "
"character and alphabet needs:<br /><br />\n"
"<b>1.</b> Visit this <a href='http://cufon.shoqolate.com/generate/' "
"target='_blank'>Cufon Generation</a> website.<br />\n"
"<b>2.</b> The next step is to convert the desired font on your computer to "
"Cufon. &nbsp;Fields are provided for selecting regular, bold and italic "
"typefaces.<br />\n"
"<b>3.</b> In the Glyphs section choose which glyphs should be included. "
"&nbsp;Choosing All is NOT recommended because the JS file size will increase "
"dramatically. Choose glyphs wisely. &nbsp;The list below is the Striking "
"selection:<br />\n"
"- Uppercase<br />\n"
"- Lowercase<br />\n"
"- Numerals<br />\n"
"- Punctuation<br />\n"
"- WordPress punctuation<br />\n"
"- Basic Latin<br />\n"
"- Latin-1 Supplement<br />\n"
"<b>4.</b> It is optional as to whether you specifiy a specific domain in the "
"Security section, and the final two sections can be left at their default "
"values. &nbsp;Accept the terms, click on the &#34;Let's Do This&#34; button "
"and save the generated script.<br />\n"
"<b>5.</b> Upload the generated font.js file to /wp-content/themes/striking/"
"fonts folder through your\n"
"FTP Client.<br />\n"
"<b>6.</b> Refresh the Striking -> Font panel, and in the <b>Choose Cufon "
"Font</b> selector one should see the custom cufon font in the list.</p>\n"

"<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>\n"
"<p>@font-face is a font-replacement technique that uses a CSS rule to enable "
"the viewing of a font on a Web page even if that font is not installed on "
"the user's computer. &nbsp;Font face has some excellent advantages versus "
"either Cufon or Google fonts in that as it does not generate the same "
"scripting burden on page load generated by either Cufon or Google text "
"technologies, and it does not generate the outside api calls that google "
"fonts generate which sometimes can result in a big impact on page loading "
"time (the page loading delays or stalls while awaiting a response from the "
"google api).  &nbsp;So it is generally the fastest and lightest of the three "
"text font technologies, and highly recommended as the first choice for "
"custom use.</p>\n"
"<p>Striking includes 45 of the most popular royalty free @font-face fonts "
"for use in customizing the appearence of text in a website.</p>\n"
"<h3>USAGE</h3>\n"
"<p>The first step is to enable the fontface scripts within the theme via the "
"<b>Enable @font-face</b> setting below.  &nbsp;With this setting - fontface "
"is turned on, but not active in replacement of any text within the site.</"
"p>\n"
"<p>Step 2 is to choose a fontface font in the <b>Choose @fontface Font</b> "
"setting, which once one selects a fontface font makes it an available "
"fontface font for replacing some of the web font usage, but still not "
"actively replacing any text in the site as it has not been told what to "
"replace.</p>\n"
"<p>Once one has made available a fontface font for replacement one has two "
"choices:</p><p>1) Use custom css pasted into the <b>@fontface Custom CSS "
"Code Field</b> below to selectively replace the regular web font where one "
"desires (samples are provided in its help field), or</p><p>2) Turn <em>ON</"
"em> the setting for <b>Enable @fontface Replacment for all Descriptive Text "
"Types</b> (this field is ajaxed and only appears once one has chosen a font "
"in Step 2 above)in which case the selected fontface font will replace the "
"base theme web font for all the descriptive font usages in Striking (see "
"help field for the list).</p>\n"
"<h3>ADDING A NEW @FONT-FACE FONT</h3>\n"
"<p>It is certainly possible to add additional @Font-Face fonts to the theme "
"but it is a fairly complex process - the explanation below touches only on "
"the very outline of the necessary steps but covering the process in detail "
"is outside the scope of this theme documentation. &nbsp;Here is the outline "
"of the steps:<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<b>1)</b> Go to: <a href='http://www.fontsquirrel.com/' "
"target='_blank'>Fontsquirrel</a> and choose a font<br />\n"
"<b>2)</b> Download the @font-face kit from Fontsquirrel or generate a kit at "
"<a href='http://www.fontsquirrel.com/' target='_blank'>Fontsquirrel "
"Generator</a>\n"
" (preferred)<br />\n"
"<b>3)</b> Using an FTP client to access your host web server, go to\n"
"wp-content/themes/striking-r/fontfaces directory.<br />\n"
"<b>4)</b> Move the unziped directory to your host server.<br />\n"
"<b>5)</b> Then refresh this tab, and one should see the font now appearing "
"in the list of @font-face fonts available.</p>\n"
"<h3>PAID SUPPORT FOR CUSTOM FONT GENERATION AND CUSTOM CSS REPLACEMENT</h3>\n"
"<p>On a paid basis the Striking development team can undertake custom @font-"
"face generation as well as creating custom replacement in a site. &nbsp;"
"Contact a support team member via the Striking Support Forum for more "
"information on this service.</p>\n"
"<p><b><u>At the Striking Support site there is a link to an additional "
"fontface package for sale for a nominal cost, containing 35 new @font-face "

"<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>\n"
"<p>Striking MultiFlex supports the use of Google fonts, which is essentially "
"a very easy way of using non-system fonts in a website.  &nbsp;Google fonts "
"are a simplified way of using @font-face fonts with all of the font files "
"being resident on the google servers rather then included in the theme core "
"files. &nbsp;This provides the user access to a very large typeface library "
"without the penalty of storage of the actual typeface files within their "
"webhost.<p>\n"
"<p>The downside of google fonts are that the website generates external "
"scripting actions to the google server, which adds to the page loading "
"burden (and thus time to complete page load) and as one will find sometimes, "
"cause a page to load very slowly or stall out due to a routing problem or "
"heavy burden on the api at that exact moment (ie google server resources "
"allocated to the font api). &nbsp;Another issue is that in some countries, "
"access to the google api may be erratic or blocked which will then have a "
"serious impact on the site appearence - something to keep in mind depending "
"on the geographic focus of a website.</p>\n"
"<p>The big upside of google fonts is the library has grown over time and "
"Striking MultiFlex offers 738 google fonts (the entire library at time of "
"publication of the theme) and google manages all the licensing of these "
"fonts eliminating this concern for the user.</p>\n"
"<h3>USAGE</h3>\n"
"<p>The 1st step is to enable the theme google oriented scripts via the "
"<b>Enable Google Font</b> setting below.  &nbsp;With this setting the "
"internal google scripting is turned on, but not yet active in replacement of "
"any text within the site.</p>\n"
"<p>Once one has made available a Google font for replacement one has two "
"choices:</p><p>1) Use custom css pasted into the <b>Google Font Custom CSS "
"Code Field</b> below to selectively replace the regular web font where one "
"desires (samples are provided in its help field), or</p><p>2) Turn <em>ON</"
"em> the setting for <b>Enable a Google Font Replacment for all Descriptive "
"Text Types</b> (this field is ajaxed and only appears once one has chosen a "
"font in Step 1 above)in which case the selected Google font will replace the "
"base theme web font for all the descriptive font usages in Striking (see "

"<p align=\"justify\">It is not recommended that one employ more then 2-4 "
"custom google fonts at any one time as more active can lead to a larger "
"increase in site loading time.  &nbsp;There are only two font styles: normal "
"and italics. &nbsp;The default font style is always normal, so one does not "
"need to specify it in a css rule if &#8220;normal&#8221; appears in the font "
"name. &nbsp;&nbsp;If the font name has the text &#8220;italic&#8221; in it, "
"you should add <code>font-style: italic;</code> to the css rules.</p>\n"
"<p>The nomenclature is as follows for <u>font weight</u>:<ul>\n"
"<li>Ultra-Light 100 =>  font weight:100</li>\n"
"<li>Light 200 => font weight:200</li>\n"
"<li>Book 300 => font weight:300</li>\n"
"<li>Normal 400 => font weight:400</li>\n"
"<li>Medium 500 => font weight:500</li>\n"
"<li>Semi-Bold 600 => font weight:600</li>\n"
"<li>Bold 700 => font weight:700</li>\n"
"<li>Extra-Bold 800 => font weight:800</li>\n"
"<li>Ultra-Bold 900 => font weight:900</li>\n"
"<li>regular => font weight:400</li>\n"
"<ul></p>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">Thus if a font has in its name &#8220;Book&#8221; or "
"&#8220;Semi-Bold&#8221; these are just descriptors we have added to the font "
"name so that you have a visual representation of the &#8220;weight&#8221; of "
"the font. &nbsp;&nbsp;They have no meaning as far as writing a css rule. "
"&nbsp;&nbsp;So if a font that you wish to use for some font replacement is "
"&#8220;Semi-Bold 600&#8221;, all you need in the css rule is <code>font-"
"weight: 600;</code> as part of the specification in the custom font rule you "
"are creating.</p>\n"
"<p>Here are some sample code snippets for substitution and you can copy and "
"paste any of these into the custom css field below to give you a starting "
"point for creating your own rule, changing the element and attribute as "
"appropriate:</p>\n"
"<p><ul> \n"
"<li><code>h1, h2 {<br/>font-family:\"Open Sans\", serif;<br/>\n"
"font-weight: 700;<br/>\n"
"font-style: normal;<br/>\n"
"text-shadow: 4px 4px 4px #aaa;<br/>\n"
"}</code></li>\n"
"<li><code>h4 {font-family:\"Averia Sans Libre\"}</code></li>\n"
"<li><code>#navigation a {<br/>font-family:\"Advent Pro\", sans;<br/>\n"
"font-weight: 200;<br/>\n"
"font-style: normal;<br/>\n"
"}</code></li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"Notice that to a couple of the rules we added &#8220;serif&#8221; and &#8220;"
"sans&#8221; - this is so that if a browser does not recognize the custom "
"font it has a fallback.  &nbsp;&nbsp;In the first rule, we also added some "
"text shadowing, just one of the many special effects one can add to a font.</"

"user to format and display their content in interesting ways without "
"requiring any knowledge of the dreaded wordpress &#34;hooks&#34; and &#34;"
"filters&#34; or html, css, php and js.  &nbsp;At the same time, Striking "
"incorporates the necessary tools allowing advanced users and designers who "
"are comfortable with web code to incorporate custom html, css and js into "
"their design: some examples of this are custom css and custom js fields, "
"advanced functions like inline lightbox capability, and fields in some "
"shortcodes for assigning classes or id for custom css to modify the "
"shortcode output.</p>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">To assist all users with their design imperatives, "
"Striking MultiFlex provides 3 main resources for configuring the look of a "
"website:</p><ul>\n"
"<li><b>Administration Panels</b> - theme level custom settings</li>\n"
"<li><b>Metaboxes</b> - page & post level custom settings</li>\n"
"<li><b>Shortcodes</b> - content level custom settings</li></ul>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">Between these 3 methods are hundreds of optional "
"settings that allow one to manipulate the appearence of the website down to "
"the granular level.  &nbsp;Every setting has a preconfigured default, so one "
"can take one&#34;s time to learn how each setting will benefit the "
"customization of a site, without being hindered at the outset of the site "
"implementation.</p>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">The &#34;Help&#34; dropdown at the top of the Striking "
"General Panel has detailed information on the 3 Striking resources and some "

"<h2 class=\"theme_help_title\">STRIKING MULTIFLEX SUPPORT</h2>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">Support for Striking MultiFlex is divided into two "
"categories:  Product Support and Custom Support. &nbsp;A free to register "
"support site with a forum is maintained by the Striking Developer for "
"interaction between the theme support staff, and users. &nbsp;Under "
"consideration is a more formalized ticket system and other support devices.</"
"p>\n"
"<h3><em>Product Support</em></h3>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">Product Support is free and refers to:<br />\n"
"<b>a)</b> <u>Keeping the theme bug free</u> and attending to any bugs that "
"are reported by users.<br />\n"
"<b>b)</b> <u>Updating the theme from time to time</u> for changes that have "
"occurred to the wordpress core, to browsers, and to scripts that are "
"incorporated into the theme so that the theme continues to work in good "
"order.<br />\n"
"<b>c)</b> <u>Answering general usage questions</u> from users about theme "
"related matters such as where to find a setting or what is the purpose of a "
"setting and its effect.</p>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">Questions on implementation of a feature may or may not "
"fall into the product support category, and are determined on a case by case "
"basis at the sole discretion of the support team. &nbsp;At official release "
"Striking MultiFlex will include very detailed built-in help fields for most "
"settings, and a video series which will illustrate all core functionality.</"
"p> \n"
"<p align=\"justify\">Past experience via 10,000+ questions has taught the "
"support team that most issues arise when a user is unfamiliar with basic "
"wordpress conventions, has not read the help fields or documentation, or is "
"attempting to customize via custom css/html/js/php or plugins without a good "
"understanding of web code. &nbsp;The support team will usually attempt to "
"point the way towards the wp codex for understanding, point the way to the "
"correct help fields & documentation and expand upon the matter if relevant. "
"&nbsp;Customization matters are dealt with in the Customer Support section "
"below.</p>\n"
"<h3><em>Customer Support</em></h3>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\"><u>Customer Support refers to anything that is not "
"covered by Product Support.</u> &nbsp;In general, customer support includes "
"the following: custom html/css implementation, website design, website "
"transfer, SEO, requests that involve php or js modifications, anything to do "
"with custom fields and non-theme custom post types, 3rd party plugin usage "
"and integration, plugin debugging.  &nbsp;<u>All such requests are paid "
"support.</u> &nbsp;We maintain a free to post open forum where uses can post "
"such questions in order to seek help from each other, and have an extensive "
"library of forum questions that can assist with many such queries.</p>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">To clarify, the theme is provided &#34;as is&#34;, and "
"any situation wherein one wants to modify the appearence, or a function "
"behaviour, outside of the theme supplied settings range is &#34;"
"customization&#34; and support is normally proferred on a paid basis only. "
"&nbsp;Whether it be changing the theme CSS for one specific instance, or "
"loading a new font into the theme, or modifying the header to accept some "
"custom php or a code object, or difficulty with a plugin, all these and more "
"are work outside of the Striking theme defaults and standing core, and are "
"thus paid support.</p>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">The theme support forum has more detailed information "
"on support topics and at any time a user is welcome to query via the forum "
"tools a support team member on a matter and how it is covered in support "
"policy. &nbsp;The support team has an excellent reputation for providing "
"liberal support in the past, and does intend to continue this tradition but "
"there have been frequent and flagrant abuses of the free support model and "
"so it is trusted that the above guidelines assist all users in determining "
"the nature of what is supported and the appropriate terms of that support.</"
"p>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">Nothing in the policy above is intended to counteract "
"the licensing of the Striking MultiFlex theme by Themeforest and when in "
"doubt the Themeforest licensing shall apply. &nbsp;The Striking MultiFlex "
"theme developer reserves the right to cancel the theme and support at any "
"time without notice. &nbsp;Per Themeforest licensing, successful downloading "
"of the theme package from the Themeforest website fulfills in full all "
"obligations of Themeforest and the Striking MultiFlex developer in respect "
"of the theme product and nothing contained herein this Theme Support policy "
"is intended to imply any other obligation, in whole or in part, otherwise.</"

"<h2 class=\"theme_help_title\">STRIKING MULTIFLEX ADMINISTRATION PANELS</"
"h2>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">Striking has 13 administration panels (also called "
"screens but we will use <em>panel</em> throughout the theme help dialogs) "
"which contain between them hundreds of settings and functions organized into "
"tab groupings of related items. &nbsp;Access to the panels is twofold -> via "
"an addition to the WP navigation menu below the Settings nav group under "
"&#34;Striking&#34;, and optionally, as another navigation item in the WP "
"Admin toolbar found at the top of any administration panel. &nbsp;The "
"Striking Advanced Panel ->General Tab has a setting for enabling/disabling "
"the Striking panel links in the admin toolbar.<br /><br />The settings and "
"functions in the Striking panels are typically used to set a behaviour to a "
"website characteristic, such as a color, typeface, fontsize, background, or "
"a facet of a content item such as a post featured image position. <b><span "

"<h2 class=\"theme_help_title\">STRIKING MULTIFLEX METABOXES</h2>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">In the edit panel work area when editing a page or a "
"post, one will see new theme related boxes (called metaboxes) added by the "
"theme code, usually placed below the main content editor. &nbsp;An example "
"metabox is the <b>Blog Single Options</b> metabox appearing below the "
"content editor when adding or editing a blog post. &nbsp;Some metaboxes such "
"as the <b>Page General Options</b> metabox appear in almost all work area "
"panels, and others are specific to a type of post being edited.</p>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">The purpose of the metaboxes is to provide settings for "
"applying a behaviour of a charateristic or function specifically to that "
"page or post.  Typically the array of settings will fall into the following "
"purposes:</p><ul>\n"
"<li>Some settings will be designed to provide the ability to negate, or "
"oppose a theme setting for the same function/characteristic in a Striking "
"Panel. &nbsp;For example, the Striking Blog Panel contains a setting for "
"setting the conditions of display of the post featured image in the feature "
"header content area. &nbsp;However, the Blog Single Options metabox has a "
"setting which allows for showing the opposite condition of the theme setting."
"</li>\n"
"<li>There are settings will allow for customizing the appearence of that "
"specific page or post, such as assigning a custom sidebar, selecting the "
"type of feature header to be used on the page, loading a special background "
"for that page/post only, setting different background colors, creating "
"custom css only for that page, and many other page specific controls.</li>\n"
"\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">The number of settings in a metabox will vary, ranging "
"for just 1 setting with a selector in the Image Hover Effects Metabox "
"appearing in the Woocommerce Edit Product panel to the 29 settings in 3 tabs "
"appearing in the Page General Options Metabox. <b><span style=\"color:"
"#0c4892\">Thus Striking Metaboxes are intended to provide resources for "
"exercising granular control of website appearence at the page/post level.</"
"span></b></p>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">The table below contains a list of the metaboxes and "
"where they are found. &nbsp;Sometimes the metabox will not display on theme "
"activation, or you may not have a need for it. &nbsp;The appearence of "
"metaboxes, both WP default and Striking, is activated & deactivated by "
"checkboxes in the Screen Options Tab in the upper right handcorner of the "
"administration panel. &nbsp;There is also a setting in the Striking Advanced "
"Panel/Metabox Tab for presets for the Page General Options Metabox.</p>\n"

"<h2 class=\"theme_help_title\">STRIKING MULTIFLEX SHORTCODES</h2>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">Different themes have different approaches for enabling "
"assistance in content delivery in a page or post. &nbsp;The wordpress "
"default themes provides only the content editor with a few buttons (an "
"integrated script called \"tinymce\" provides the buttons and their "
"associated functions) for applying some very basic html to content.  &nbsp;"
"The WP core developers advocate that most other functionality should be "
"obtained by plugins, or editing the core files using the supplied cdoe "
"editor, to customize the look. &nbsp;This approach does not work for the "
"average user for a variety of reasons the list of which is to far to long to "
"go into here.</p>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">Wordpress eventually got the message that this approach "
"was very cumbersome and in WP 2.5 created a shortcode api for plugin "
"developers -> a set of functions within the WP core which developers could "
"hook into and would allow them to create macro codes for use in post "
"content, the goal being to allow an end user to be able to post a short "
"string into the post editor which results in an action or display of some "
"preformatted content. &nbsp;To the &#34;horror&#34; of the WP core team, "
"premium theme developers have come along and used this api along with theme "
"custom code to generate shortcodes for your use without the burden of a "
"plugin (Wordpress does this as well - hence the wp gallery function, but "
"just because they did it did not mean anyone else was supposed to....).</p>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">The Striking MultiFlex & Ecommerce Premium Wordpress "
"Theme provides the user with what may very well be the most powerful array "
"of theme shortcodes anywhere for generating varied, unique formatted content "
"into a page or post. &nbsp;<b><span style=\"color:#0c4892\">Comprising over "
"110 shortcodes (at this time!) access to the Striking MultiFlex shortcodes "
"is via a button appearing in the tinymce button group at the top of the "
"content editor</span></b> -> in the visual mode look for the last button in "
"the first row, with a stylized capital &#34;S&#34; in the button frame, and "
"in the text editor look for the &#34;Shortcodes&#34; button, again last "
"button in the first row.</p>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">Clicking on the shortcode button will open up a list of "
"sub-items, representing shortcode groups such as layouts, columns, "
"typography, etc, and each group leader has in turn more another level of "
"items, representing the actual shortcodes. &nbsp;Selecting one of the "
"shortcodes will cause a dialogue box to open in the url window, containing "
"settings that have selectors or input fields for customizing the shortcode "
"function. &nbsp;The bottom of the dialogue box allows one to cancel the "
"dialogue, preview the result (in the dialogue box) if so desired, and save "
"the shortcode. &nbsp;Saving the shortcode results in a shortcode string "
"being placed into the content editor, and it will appear similar to the "
"following:</p>\n"
"<code>[portfolio column=\"3\" max=\"10\" sortable=\"true\" ajax=\"true\" "
"titleLinkable=\"true\" desc_length=\"50\" advanceDesc=\"true\" more=\"true\" "
"lightboxTitle=\"image\" group=\"true\" effect=\"hover\"]</code><br />\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">This example is a portfolio shortcode and its code is a "
"set of instructions indicating the formatting and content to be shown in the "
"page at the place the portfolio shortcode is inserted. &nbsp;While at the "
"outset these code strings will be unfamiliar we can advise from user "
"feedback over the years that in fact it takes only a short time for the "
"average person to quickly start to understand the intent of the code, so "
"much so that some users eventually get used to typing in the simpler "
"shortcode strings from memory skipping the shortcode button altogether!! "
"&nbsp;User feedback has been so overwhelmingly in favour of shortcodes (and "
"panels as well as new settings for the metaboxes) given how they simplify "
"matters for non-coders that the number of shortcodes in Striking has grown "
"by at least 40% since theme inception due to the building in of requests "
"from users.</p>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">So whereas Panels provide pan-website level controls, "
"and metaboxes page/post level control, <b><span style=\"color:"
"#0c4892\">Shortcodes are designed to give fine grain formatting control at "
"the content level.</span></b> The following table lists the shortcode groups "
"and their attending shortcodes:</p>\n"
"<br /><div class=\"strikinghelptable\">\n"

"<h2 class=\"theme_help_title\">STRIKING MULTIFLEX ECOMMERCE</h2>\n"
"<h3>Types of Ecommerce Themes</h3>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">Striking MultiFlex possesses significant custom "
"ecommerce specific features and functions.  &nbsp;However, it is worthwhile "
"to quickly summarize wordpress themes in respect of ecommerce adaptability "
"in order to obtain some context of where MultiFlex fits and it&#180;s "
"features in respect of ecommerce capabilities:</p>\n"
"<ol>\n"
"<li><p align=\"justify\">The wordpress theme provides <u>no specific "
"ecommerce support</u> whatsoever in its code and use of any ecommerce plugin "
"is entirely hit and miss in respect of it working within the theme "
"(effectively this describes the default wordpress themes and pretty much all "
"free themes in the wordpress.org theme library).</p></li>\n"
"<li><p align=\"justify\">The theme provides some <u>limited ecommerce "
"support</u>, at least to the extent of coding so that a particular ecommerce "
"plugin(s) will not conflict but the theme otherwise has little or no "
"specific custom ecommerce oriented features (some advanced free themes and "
"entry level premium themes ($25-$40 range). </p></li>\n"
" <li><p align=\"justify\">The theme is <u>coded for a specific ecommerce "
"plugin</u> (which is sometimes integrated into its core as a built-in "
"plugin) or implements an ecommerce script (often a proprietary script), and "
"is coded to facilitate the look and workings of the integration. &nbsp;"
"Usually in this situation no other ecommerce plugin will work with the theme "
"so the user is restricted to the integrated plugin/script for ecommerce use, "
"and sometimes is limited to only the features programmed within the theme "
"(select advanced premium themes, and ecommerce dedicated themes).</p></li>\n"
"<li><p align=\"justify\">The theme provides <u>broad ecommerce support</u>, "
"perhaps by way of both coding to eliminate conflicts with one or more "
"ecommerce plugins, and specific code to facilitate certain features in one "
"or more ecommerce plugins (rare).</p></li>\n"
"</ol>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As the philosophy of MultiFlex is to be multipurpose and flexible, our "
"theme encompasses both #3 & #4 above:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p align=\"justify\"><b><span style=\"color:#0c4892\">MultiFlex has custom "
"design and features specifically coded for WooCommerce</span></b> which "
"slots Multiflex into the 3rd category above.  &nbsp;The theme customization "
"specifically for Woo includes:\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li> Extensive restyling the Woo shop and single product pages into a new "
"more modern appearence by custom code</li>\n"
"<li>Replacing the woo image scripts with the Striking Image scripts (resize "
"and lightbox)</li>\n"
"<li>Adding Image Hover Effects to thumbnails appearing on the catalog page</"
"li>\n"
"<li>Creating a new theme master CSS alternate for when Woo is activated to "
"avoid conflict with the Woo CSS (as it uses CSS classnames usually reserved "
"for themebuilders)</li>\n"
"<li>Added RTL support for Woo in Striking MultiFlex</li>\n"
"<li>A dedicate Woo Administration admin tab in the theme admin panels "
"containing woo specific administration settings (layouts, feature headers, "
"breadcrumbs, colors, default sidebars, etc)</li>\n"
"<li>Coding enabling parsing of custom breadcrumb functions from WP SEO onto "
"Woo pages.</li></ul></p>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">The Woo plugin is not included in the theme pack. &nbsp;"
"Install it as you would any other plugin, activate it, activate the Woo "
"specfic theme settings which align the theme for Woo usage (see the Woo "
"section of the documentation) and you are good to go!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p align=\"justify\"><b><span style=\"color:#0c4892\">However, Multiflex "
"also has both specific core coding to support the functionality of another "
"very popular ecommerce plugin Easy Digital Downloads (EDD), and a set of "
"abilities and features which are designed to work with any custom post type "
"based ecommerce plugin.</span></b> &nbsp;Please note the plugin must have "
"valid and up-to-date code (including compatible with WP 3.8+), have "
"registered its custom post type properly (if using custom post types for "
"creating products) and has enqueued its scripts properly and used unique css "
"classes for its style. &nbsp;If the plugin works on the basis of shortcodes "
"only with no post template then as long as the code rules are followed it "
"has an excellent chance of being compatible with Striking MultiFlex.</p>\n"
"<p>The custom MultiFlex features applicable to any ecommerce plugins, "
"including Woo and EDD are:\n"
"<ol>\n"
"<li>Custom Product Carousel which displays single product items.</li>\n"
"<li>Ability to customize the appearence of any catalogue/shop or single "
"product page for layout, colors, feature header (which has unlimited "
"variations incl slideshow, images, custom html content, and more), "
"background, and body content, etc (about 30 settings) by way of the Page "
"General Options Metabox which is filtered into the catalog and single "
"product edit panels generated by the plugins.</li>\n"
"<li>Ability to assign a custom sidebar to plugin custom post page types, "
"custom post archive type pages, and custom post type taxonomy pages.</li>\n"
"<li>Ability to exclude from website search results the CPT, its media, or "
"taxonomies.</li>\n"
"<li>An admin tab enabling setting Custom Post Type Archive Featured Header "
"Titles and Text (which supports html and theme shortcodes) for plugin "
"archive types generated</li>\n"
"<li>An admin tab enabling setting Custom Taxonomy Featured Header Titles and "
"Text (which supports html and theme shortcodes) for plugin taxonomies "
"generated</li>\n"
"</li></ol>\n"
"This array of features and abilities which allow customizing of any "
"ecommerce plugin content places Striking MultiFlex squarely into the 4th "
"category of ecommerce themes as well.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Compatible Ecommerce Plugins</h3>\n"
" <p>As noted above, Striking has specific code to support the working of 2 "
"of the most popular ecommerce plugins from the wp codex, and <b><span style="
"\"color:#0c4892\">they can be activated at the same time in the theme "
"without conflict if desired</span></b>: \n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>WooCommerce - oriented towards traditional products historically</li>\n"
"<li>Easy Digital Downloads - an ecommerce plugin oriented towards digital "
"downloads</li>\n"
"</ul></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">Both have many add-on plugins available.  Together they "
"provide the opportunity for a large and sophisticated ecommerce site selling "

"<h2 class=\"theme_help_title\">INTRODUCTION</H2>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">A portfolio item is a custom post type created "
"especially for the Striking MultiFlex theme. &nbsp;Its purpose is to allow "
"for creation of varied types of media content that can be displayed in "
"condensed form via a list, and each list item may by choice lead to a full "
"post webpage containing additional content.  &nbsp;The full post can contain "
"expanded descriptive content fully customized as desired. &nbsp;So a "
"portfolio &#34;Item&#34; is simply a post, and like a blog post, it can have "
"short form display (lists, widgets) and long form display with as much "
"content as needed.</p>\n"
"<h3>Difference between a Portfolio List and a WP Gallery</h3>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">There is often confusion between a portfolio post and a "
"wp gallery. &nbsp;In fact as noted a portfolio post is a post type in "
"wordpress, whereas a gallery is a display of images and is not a post type "
"at all.  &nbsp;But a portfolio list can consist simply of a group of images, "
"identical on first appearence to a wp gallery and as a result this often "
"confuses people upon the differences between them. &nbsp;So here is some of "
"the key differences: <ol>\n"
"<li>A portfolio list can (in MultiFlex) be used to display many types of "
"media including images, audio tracks, different types of videos, pdfs, and "
"more, whereas a wp gallery can display only images;</li>\n"
"<li>There can be many different portfolio lists in the body content of a "
"page or post and each be restricted by lightbox grouping whereas if there "
"are  multiple wp galleries inserted in a page, they will group automatically "
"into one lightbox if the &#34;Link to Media File&#34; option has been "
"selected in the wp gallery creation options.</li>\n"
"<li>Portfolio lists allow for display be categories and can be filtered and "
"ordered by a very wide range of parameters to display only certain portfolio "
"categories or individual items whereas a wp gallery has no filtering other "
"then the ability to select specific images from the media library.</li>\n"
"<li>Each item in a portfolio list can have a caption, a title, a read more "
"button, and excerpt content just like each post in a blog list, whereas a WP "
"Gallery can have only images with captions. &nbsp;Furthermore, the thumbnail "
"image, and read more button for the same item can have different linking "
"actions, none of which is possible with the wp gallery. </li>\n"
"<li>The thumbnail image appearing in a portfolio list can perform many "
"functions such as opening a lightbox that displays many types of media, or "
"be a direct link to a page, post or outside url.  &nbsp;An image in a wp "
"gallery can only be static (ie a non-active image just sitting in the page "
"content), open to a bigger version of itself in a lightbox, or open to the "
"image attachment page.</li>\n"
"</ol>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">Due to the above characteristics the key positive to "
"portfolios is that they are a huge leap in flexibility for display of mixed "
"media content. &nbsp;The negative of portfolios is that creation is slightly "
"more time consuming, thus making larger portfolio lists requires the "
"creation of many portfolio items, whereas a simple image gallery can be "
"quickly created by grabbing some images from the media library. &nbsp;"
"Creating portfolios requires a greater time investment with the tradeof "
"being much greater utilty and flexibility for display of the content.</p>\n"
"<h3 align=\"center\">Portfolio Types and General Information</H3>\n"
" <p align=\"justify\">There are <u>8 different Portfolio Types</u> available "
"in Striking designed to fulfill every conceivable portfolio display "
"requirement.  &nbsp;The <b>Set the Portfolio Type of this Post</b> setting "
"in the <b>Portfolio Post Metabox</b> has a detailed help field discussing "
"the 8 types and the use for each.  &nbsp;After selecting a type in the "
"setting dropdown field its corresponding admin tab (left of that setting "
"dialogue) will become active and this is where the specific settings for "
"that portfolio type can be adjusted.</p>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\"><u>Please note it is necessary to set a featured image, "
"and give the portfolio item a title</u> for all Portfolio Types. &nbsp;The "
"Portfolio Type choice determines the action of the featured image thumbnail "
"when selected by a site viewer - it will either open a lightbox with content "
"or transport the website viewer somewhere else in the site, or even to an "
"external url.</p>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">Striking MultiFlex does not restrict portfolio display "
"to a special page template, the case with most themes.  &nbsp;In MultiFlex, "
"a portfolio list can be inserted in any page or post content, and can range "
"in size from just one item in the list to as many as desired. &nbsp;All the "
"settings for creating a list/display of portfolio items in any webpage are "
"found in the portfolio shortcode, and some portfolio behaviours can be "
"standardized sitewide for lists or the post page by way of settings in the "
"panel below. <span style=\"color:#0c4892\">There are no practical display "
"limits for portfolio lists or portfolio items in MultiFlex.  &nbsp;A page "
"can have just one instance of the portfolio shortcode, or it can have 10 "
"separate instances (ex- each list only displays one category). &nbsp;A "
"website built with Striking MultiFlex can have an unlimited number of "
"portfolio lists, and portfolio items.</span></b></p>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">Unless otherwise stated all portfolio list thumbnail "
"images open into a lightbox. &nbsp;In some instances it is possible to set a "
"custom lightbox size in a Portfolio Type tab that will override the defaults "
"found in the <b>Lightbox Dimension Tab</b> below wherein are set the theme "
"defaults for the various portfolio lightbox types.</p>  \n"
"<p align=\"justify\">Finally, the portfolio items grouped into a portfolio "
"category are entirely determined by choice -> a portfolio category may be "
"used to group same type items or it can have a mixed group of portfolio "
"types - there are no restrictions of any sort as to what portfolio items are "
"placed into any portfolio category.  &nbsp;Portfolio Categories are like "
"shelves in a bookcase, what is put in them and how they are organized is all "
"according to choice and convenience. &nbsp;The Portfolio Shortcode is used "
"to display the portfolio items, grouped by category(s), or selected "
"individually, as part of the content.</p>"

"<h2 class=\"theme_help_title\">FEATURED AND THUMBNAIL IMAGES</H2>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">Very simply, <u>a &#34;Featured Image&#34; is an image "
"that is automatically associated with a post or page.</u> &nbsp;It is an "
"image that wordpress displays along with the post, in various formats "
"whether a widget, or a full webpage, as long as a theme supports the "
"functions necessary for displaying a featured image. &nbsp;It if often "
"described as the visual &#34;headline&#34; for a post.</p>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">Striking provides the ability to display a featured "
"image with all post types in the theme. &#34;When landing on a single post "
"webpage, the featured image can be shown in its maximum displayable size "
"(which may be smaller then its actual size). &nbsp;<u>When the featured "
"image is shown in a list using a shortcode, or in a widget, it is referred "
"to as the &#34;thumbnail&#34; meaning that it is smaller version of the "
"featured image.</u></p>\n"
"<h4>Featured Images and the WP Auto Resizing function</h4>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">Featured image sizing sometimes seems complicated as "
"whether being displayed in a post or in a thumbnail, each of these image "
"spaces has a different dimension (W x H) and if the uploaded image does not "
"conform to the dimensions of all space allotted for it, or at least be in "
"the same ratio of W x H, then wordpress automatically  crops and scales the "
"image to fit the space. &nbsp;The wp auto resizing functions for slotting an "
"image into any sized space are intended to be helpful, but they often result "
"in an image either losing some relevant portion, or it being scaled upwards "
"(as the image is smaller then the alloted space) resulting in artifacting "
"and blurriness.</p>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">To stop the wp auto resizing from being an issue (it is "
"frowned upon to actually disable and other facets of the wp resizing "
"functions are beneficial) the Striking post and shortcode functions have "
"help fields listing the correct featured image sizing.</p>\n"
"<h4>Featured Images Options</h4>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">Also available in Striking are settings to turn off the "
"display of the featured image in the single post, so that if a better "
"quality or differently sized image is available, it can be inserted into the "
"single post content by using the image shortcode.</p>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">Another portfolio scenario -> if the featured image was "
"loaded solely to be the thumbnail image in post list for an audio, video or "
"document portfolio item, then it is likely not desirable to have the "
"featured image show in the single post webpage, so the ability to turn off "
"the featured image for these scenarios allows removal of an unnecessary "
"piece of content.</p>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">Finally, in Striking the featured image can be edited "
"at any time via the built-in wp media editor to create a unique thumbnail "
"size for post widgets which have square thumbnails, and the Striking video "
"library has a video on Editing Media for Widget Thumbnails to guide on this "
"matter.</p>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">In summary, Striking has a very signficant array of "
"featured image abilities to compliment the various portfolio and blog "
"display options available in the theme.  &nbsp;The help fields and videos "
"are guides to sizing featured images and their thumbnails correctly. &nbsp;"
"The portfolio and blog shortcode help fields list the featured image sizes "
"as do the correct settings in the Portfolio and Blog Panels. <font  color="
"\"Red\"><b>So it is suggested, prior to uploading a featured image, one "
"should decide the type of portfolio or blog list array (1 column, 2 column, "
"etc) for which the post is being created, and and check the array help to "
"confirm the correct featured image dimensions for the <i>Set Featured Image</"
"i> function in the post creation so that it&#180;s thumbnail version "
"appearing in the list is resized correctly.</b></font></p>\n"

"<h2 class=\"theme_help_title\">PORTFOLIO ITEM DISPLAY</H2>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">There are 2 steps to showing a portfolio in a webpage: "
"creating some portfolio items, and then using the Portfolio Shortcode in the "
"content editor to call them up for display in a webpage (a &#34;portfolio "
"list&#34;):</p>\n"
"<h3>Portfolio Item Creation</h3>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">Creating a portfolio item is very straightforward:\n"
"<ol>\n"
"<li>Go to Portfolio items-> Add New in the WP admin menu.</li>\n"
"<li>Give the Item a title.</li>\n"
"<li>Categorize the Item using the <b>Portfolio Categories</b> metabox "
"settings found to the right of the editor.</li>\n"
"<li><p>Set a Featured Image using the metabox for this purpose again found "
"to the right of the content editor.  This image will show as the thumbnail "
"image in the portfolio items list. &nbsp;It is important at this stage to "
"have reviewed the <b>Height of Thumbnail Tab</b> below for the thumbnail "
"image size as it varies depending on the number of columns one and whether a "
"full width or sidebar page template.  &nbsp;The featured image loaded should "
"be the same size or larger, and in the same size ratio so that it does not "
"get cropped by the image resizing script.</p>\n"
"<p>An example: The featured image size for a one column portfolio in a "
"sidebar page is 600px wide and the theme default height is 350px (which can "
"be adjusted), this is an aspect ratio of 1.71:1. &nbsp;So the featured image "
"should be at least this size or larger, and maintain the same aspect ratio. "
"&nbsp;A featured image of 1200 x 700 would be fine as the aspect ratio is "
"still 1.71:1, and would resize downwards by wordpress to the thumbnail size "
"correctly, but an image of 1200 x 900 would crop (the aspect ratio is "
"1.33:1) and in the thumbnail a portion of the height would be shaved off "
"distorting the image. &nbsp;If the image was smaller then 600 x 350, it "
"would be magnified by the wp image resizing script and appear fuzzy as a "
"result. &nbsp;The worst option is an image that is both too small and an "
"incorrect aspect ratio as it will both distort in resizing and be cropped!</"
"p></li>\n"
"<li>Use the settings in the <b>Portfolio Post Setup & Options Metabox</b> to "
"determine the type of portfolio item, and configure via the appropriate "
"settings. &nbsp;All the settings have very detailed help fields to guide to "
"the appropriate choice(s)(most media can be displayed more then one way and "
"is according to design choice).</li>\n"
"<li>Add detail of the portfolio to the content editor. &nbsp;Portfolio posts "
"also have an Excerpt module for creating description content that will only "
"appear in the portfolio list. &nbsp;Choose either or both and fill with "
"content as appropriate. &nbsp;If the Excerpt Metabox is not visible in the "
"<b>Add New Portfolio Item</b> panel, then click on the <b>Screen Options</b> "
"Tab in the upper right hand corner of the url window which will drop down a "
"panel where there are visibility controls for various metaboxes.</li>\n"
"<li>Once done, click on the <b>Publish</b> button and the portfolio item has "
"been created.</li>\n"
"</ol>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">The process is very straightforward as long as it is "
"rememberered to size the featured images correctly (see the <b>Portfolio "
"Lists -> Thumbnail Height Settings Tab below)</b>and after performing a few "
"times, portfolio items typically take less then a minute to create.</p>\n"

"<h2 class=\"theme_help_title\">SHOWING THE PORTFOLIOS</h2>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">After creating some portfolio items we use the "
"portfolio shortcode to embed them in the content of any page or post:\n"
"<ol>\n"
"<li>Open a page or post to edit (or create a new one)</li>\n"
"<li>Go to the shortcode button in the content editor and click on the "
"porfolio shortcode - it will open a dialogue box with the settings for use "
"to configure a portfolio list.  &nbsp;After configuring the settings the "
"shortcode dialogue has a preview button at the bottom which will show how "
"the portfolio will appear in the page. &nbsp;Make any adjustments and then "
"click the <b>Insert</b> button and the portfolio shortcode string will be "
"inserted into the content editor.</li>\n"
"<li>Publish the page and all done!</li>\n"
"</ol></p>\n"
"<h3>The Shortcode String</h3>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">At first, the shortcode string will appear fairly "
"incomprehensible, but experience has shown that users soon start to "
"recognize the shortcode elements, and even just generate them from memory as "
"time progresses. &nbsp;Following are some sample shortcode strings:</p>\n"
"<p> - Show a portfolio items list without page navigation:\t<code>[portfolio "
"nopaging=\"true\"]</code><br />\n"
"This would result in every portfolio item created showing in the one "
"webpage, probably not a desired outcome unless there are only a few.</p>\n"
"<p> - Show the portfolio items list sorted with specific categories: <code>\n"
"[portfolio cat=\"document,image\" sortable=\"true\"]</code><br />\n"
"This would result in a portfolio display having two tabs, each tab being one "
"of the categories and displaying in that tab all the portfolio items "
"assigned to that category.</p>\n"
"<p> - Following is a more typical portfolio string one will generate, as it "
"has more of the shortcode settings in effect:<br /> <code>[portfolio column="
"\"5\" height=\"275\" effect=\"zoom\" max=\"15\" sortable=\"true\" ajax=\"true"
"\" cat=\"document,image, video,audio\" current=\"image\" orderby=\"author\" "
"order=\"DESC\" titleLinkable=\"true\" titleLinkTarget=\"_blank\" desc_length="
"\"75\" advanceDesc=\"true\" more=\"true\" moreButton=\"true\" lightboxTitle="
"\"imagecaption\"] </code><br /><br />\n"
"Here is what is going on in this string:<ul>\n"
"<li><code>portfolio column=\"5\"</code> This is a 5 column portfolio  -> "
"<i>Column</i> setting</li>\n"
"<li><code>height=\"275\"</code> with a custom image height of 275px -> "
"<i>Thumbnail Height</i> setting</li>\n"
"<li><code>effect=\"zoom\"</code> and an image hover effect of Zoom -> "
"<i>Thumbnail Image Effect</i> setting</li>\n"
"<li><code>max=\"15\"</code> which will only show max 15 portfolio items "
"after which it paginates -> <i>Pagination Amount</i> setting</li>\n"
"<li><code>sortable=\"true\"</code> the categories will be tabbed -> "
"<i>Enable Sortable Tabbing</i> setting</li>\n"
"<li><code>ajax=\"true\"</code> transitions when someone clicks on a category "
"tab will be via ajax -> <i>Ajax Sorting Effect</i> setting</li>\n"
"<li><code>cat=\"document,image, video,audio\"</code> the categories selected "
"for display are the document, image, video and audio categories -> "
"<i>Category(s)</i> setting</li>\n"
"<li><code>current=\"image\"</code> the category that will display when one "
"first lands on the page is the image category thumbnails -> <i>Current Tab</"
"i> setting</li>\n"
"<li><code>orderby=\"author\"</code> the actual portfolio items appearing in "
"each category will be ordered by the author who created them -> <i>Portfolio "
"Items Sorting Parameter</i> setting</li>\n"
"<li><code>order=\"DESC\"</code> the author alphabetical sorting order will "
"be descending alphabetical form -> <i>Ascending or Descending Order</i> "
"setting</li>\n"
"<li><code>titleLinkable=\"true\"</code> the portfolio item title appearing "
"below the thumbnail image will be an active link to the single post webpage -"
"> <i>Title Linkable</i> setting</li>\n"
"<li><code>titleLinkTarget=\"_blank\"</code> the portfolio post will open in "
"a new tab -> <i>Title Link Target</i> setting</li>\n"
"<li><code>desc_length=\"75\"</code> this indicates that the portfolio "
"excerpt will show a maximum of 75 characters -> <i>Description Length</i> "
"setting</li>\n"
"<li><code>advanceDesc=\"true\"</code> shortcodes used in the excerpt field "
"will show correctly in the portfolio list item descriptions -> <i>Enable "
"Shortcode Support in Description Text</i> setting</li>\n"
"<li><code>more=\"true\"</code> this short string means that the Read More "
"Text will show -> <i>Display Read More Text</i> setting</li>\n"
"<li><code>moreButton=\"true\"</code> this indicates that the Read More Text "
"will be shown within a button -> <i>Display Read More as Button</i> setting</"
"li>\n"
"<li><code>lightboxTitle=\"imagecaption\"</code> when a lightbox is opened "
"for any portfolio item in the display the caption of the lightbox will be "
"from the caption field of the media, versus the other options of the media "
"title, or the media description, or nothing at all -> <i>Lightbox Caption "
"Options</i> setting</li>\n"
"</ul></p>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\"><b>HINT -</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;If a portfolio string has been "
"set it is decided to change an option, it is not necessary to generate a "
"whole new string of all the settings again. &nbsp;Instead, generate a new "
"portfolio string consisting of just the option needed, and then cut and "
"paste it into the existing string (and don&#180;t forget to delete what is "
"left of the unneeded new portfolio shortcode). &nbsp;This is the quick cheat "
"method to rapid changes to a portfolio shortcode when working to refine the "
"look to exactly what is needed.</p>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\"><b>ANOTHER HINT -</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many options "
"to customize the appearence of the portfolio list -> the <b>Color</b> and "
"<b>Font</b> Panels both have settings applicable to portfolio display: there "
"are 9 color settings and 2 font size settings specific to portfolio lists.</"

"<h3 align='center'>FEATURED IMAGE SIZING FOR PORTFOLIO COLUMNS</h3>\n"
"<p align='justify'><ol>\n"
"<li>Striking allows for portfolio displays ranging from one to eight column "
"arrays of images.</li> \n"
"<li>Each column array may be placed in either a full width page or page with "
"sidebar.</li>\n"
"<li>The featured image (thumbnail) width setting for each column array is "
"fixed, and the height is adjustable.</li></ol> \n"
"The width of the featured image has 16 different fixed sizes -> 8 column "
"widths x 2 page types.  &nbsp;So it is important when creating any portfolio "
"item that there be a clear idea of the column array it is going to be used "
"in, since the change in column width from one column array to another is not "
"proportionate (it cannot be since there are both even and odd number "
"factorials involved).  &nbsp;If the intended thumbnail image for a "
"poortfolio list is not sized correctly for the column array it will be "
"distorted by the wp image resizing scripts - either cropped, or pixalated "
"when magnified, or both.</p>\n"
"<p align='justify'><i>The result is that if the website being designed is "
"portfolio oriented, it might be necessary to create more then one portfolio "
"item using the same image, as each portfolio item might be using a different "
"sized version of that image in order to fit correctly into the column array "
"in which it is to appear</i>. &nbsp;Programs such as Adobe photoshop, "
"Microsoft Paint or Gimp can all manage image adjustments when multiple sized "
"versions of an image are necessary.</p> \n"
"<p align='justify'>On installation, Striking has a default image width and "
"height set for each column array.  &nbsp;The height settings below enable "
"changing of the size to a new default which would apply to all shortcoded "
"portfolio lists using that column array size. &nbsp;But it was recognized "
"that there may be occasions where the default height is not suitable for a "
"particular portfolio listing, so the portfolio shortcode has a setting for "
"custom thumbnail height specific to that shortcode instance -> in that "
"situation all the portfolio items would have to have a featured image size "
"correctly to the custom height.</p>\n"
"<p align='justify'>The image widths per column for both a full page, and a "
